    "description": "The Empress of Abundance sits upon a grand, intricately designed throne that is ostentatiously decorated with withered flowers and spoiled fruits, signifying decay hidden behind opulence. Her expression is one of melancholy, a stark contrast to the riches surrounding her. This figure is draped in elaborate garments made of luxurious but heavy materials, symbolizing the pressure of excessive expectations and the inability to find joy despite having everything.",
    "meaning": "This card serves as a warning about toxic excess—where an organization may be overflowing with resources but remains shrouded in discontent and confusion. The signs of abundance may mask deeper issues of dissatisfaction and a desperate search for a fulfilling purpose that perpetually eludes them. It reflects a state of stagnation where true growth is stifled by overindulgence and misplaced values.",
    "imageDescription": "An elegant empress sits regally on a grand throne intricately carved with ornate designs, yet the throne is adorned with withered flowers and spoiled fruits, hinting at decay and neglect. Her attire is lavish, embellished with heavy silks and fine jewels, but the colors are muted and lacking vibrancy, suggesting a sense of emptiness. She gazes outward with a melancholic expression, eyes reflecting both discontent and longing, as if trapped by the very excess that surrounds her. The background is filled with dark shadows and faint outlines of opulent objects—glistening gold and silver that seem more oppressive than inviting—creating an atmosphere heavy with an unsettling energy. In this setting, joy and genuine growth appear smothered beneath layers of greed and confusion, reflecting the isolation that often accompanies an abundance devoid of fulfillment.",
