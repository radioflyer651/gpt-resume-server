## Image Description
A menacing wraith cloaked in tattered, shadowy robes flows through a darkened digital landscape, its form barely distinguishable against the backdrop of chaotic, glitching code. The wraithâ€™s hollow eyes glow ominously with a sickly green light, reflecting the remnants of outdated technology and legacy frameworks. In one skeletal hand, it clutches a rusted ASP.NET emblem that emits a faint, eerie light, symbolizing the burden of obsolete practices.

The wraith stands before a decaying, ghostly castle constructed from fragmented blocks of old code, where streams of malfunctioning data flow like twisted rivers, threatening to engulf anything in their path. The air crackles with tension, as wisps of dark energy swirl around it, hinting at the chaos and inefficiency that comes from clinging to the past. The surroundings are filled with fleeting glimpses of failed deployments and error messages, shadowed under a stormy sky that looms above, signaling the dire consequences of ignoring the need for evolution in technology.
